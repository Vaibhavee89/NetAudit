## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Important Legal Notice
**ONLY use this tool on networks you own or have explicit permission to audit.**

### Unauthorized Use is Prohibited
- Network scanning without permission may violate local laws
- Unauthorized access attempts are illegal in most jurisdictions
- Always obtain written permission before conducting security assessments

### Responsible Use Guidelines
1. **Authorization**: Obtain proper authorization before scanning
2. **Scope**: Stay within agreed-upon testing boundaries
3. **Impact**: Minimize disruption to network operations
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs of all activities
5. **Disclosure**: Follow responsible disclosure practices for vulnerabilities

## üîß Configuration

### Security Settings
- Change the Flask secret key in `webapp.py` for production use
- Configure firewall rules to restrict access if needed
- Use HTTPS in production environments

### Customization
- Modify scan parameters in the utility functions
- Customize report templates and styling
- Add additional vulnerability databases
- Extend functionality with new scan types

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Task Scheduler Database
The application uses a SQLite database to store scheduled tasks. The database file is automatically created when you run the setup script.

#### Database Files
- `scheduled_jobs.db` - Main database for scheduled tasks
- `scheduled_results/` - Directory containing task results and reports

#### Database Setup
```bash
# Initial setup (run once)
python setup_database.py

# Test database functionality
python test_database.py
```

#### Database Maintenance
- The database is automatically managed by APScheduler
- No manual maintenance required
- Database file can be safely backed up or moved
- To reset the database, delete `scheduled_jobs.db` and run `setup_database.py`

#### Database Location
- Database file: `./scheduled_jobs.db` (relative to application directory)
- Results directory: `./scheduled_results/` (created automatically)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Errors
**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors during scans
**Solution**: Run the application with administrative privileges

#### Nmap Not Found
**Problem**: "nmap command not found"
**Solution**: Install Nmap and ensure it's in your system PATH

#### Packet Capture Fails
**Problem**: Traffic analysis doesn't capture packets
**Solution**: Run with administrative privileges and check firewall settings

#### Port Scan Takes Too Long
**Problem**: Port scans are very slow
**Solution**: Reduce scan range or adjust timing parameters

#### Scheduler Database Errors
**Problem**: "Database not found" or scheduler initialization fails
**Solution**: Run `python setup_database.py` to create the database

#### Task Scheduling Not Working
**Problem**: Cannot schedule tasks or scheduler fails to start
**Solution**: 
1. Run `python setup_database.py` to ensure database exists
2. Run `python test_database.py` to verify setup
3. Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Performance Optimization
- Use smaller subnet ranges for faster network scans
- Adjust Nmap timing templates for better performance
- Limit packet capture count for traffic analysis
- Consider running scans during off-peak hours
